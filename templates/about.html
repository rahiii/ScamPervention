            <p>Congrats! You Didn’t Win an iPhone – But You Can Win at Scam Prevention is an interactive cybersecurity education platform designed to help people recognize, understand, and avoid online scams in their everyday digital lives. 
                As scams grow increasingly sophisticated—using tactics like phishing, smishing, vishing, and social engineering—traditional forms of cybersecurity education often fall short. 
                Many rely on passive methods like lectures or quizzes, which rarely reflect the urgency or emotional manipulation seen in real scam attempts. 
                This project was built on the belief that learning to stay safe online should be active, engaging, and accessible to everyone—regardless of age, background, or technical experience. 
                Our platform transforms scam education into a hands-on experience, combining clear, easy-to-understand information with interactive minigames that simulate real-world scenarios. 
                Users can practice sorting suspicious messages, building stronger passwords, and identifying common red flags—all while developing a sharper eye for digital threats.
                Grounded in extensive research from industry, government, and academia, our approach emphasizes retention through participation. 
                Every section of our site—from the educational hub to the resources page and game-based learning tools—is designed to empower users to make informed decisions and adopt better cybersecurity habits. 
                Ultimately, our mission is simple: help people protect themselves online through education that sticks.</p>
